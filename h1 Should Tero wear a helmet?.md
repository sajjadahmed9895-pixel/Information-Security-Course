## What is Threat Modeling?

Threat modeling is the process of analyzing a system to identify security and privacy risks. It helps understand how a system works and where it might be vulnerable to threats.

## Key Questions in Threat Modeling

+ What system are we working on?
+ What can go wrong?
+ What actions can we take to reduce or mitigate risks?
+ Have we done enough to address the identified threats?

## Why Threat Modeling is Important?

+ Helps identify security and privacy issues early in the system lifecycle.
+ Supports better design and implementation decisions.
+ Threats identified guide development, testing and post-deployment improvements.
+ Encourages continuous security improvement.

## Using the Threat Modeling Manifesto

+ Acts as a guiding framework rather than a step-by-step method.
+ Can be adapted to fit different organizational needs.
+ Focuses on effectiveness rather than tools or rigid processes.
+ Inspired by the Agile Manifesto.
