# Schneier (2015) Applied Cryptography

The basic concepts of cryptography by explaining how secure communication works between two parties. The main idea is that a sender wants to send information securely to a receiver so that unauthorized people cannot read or understand the message. Cryptography is the tools and methods that protect this communication. So the main goal of cryptography is to ensure that even if someone intercepts the message, they cannot understand it without proper authorization.

## Encryption and Decryption terms

+ Plaintext: The original readable message before any protection is applied.
+ Encryption: The process of converting plaintext into a secret form to hide its meaning.
+ Ciphertext: The encrypted message that appears unreadable to anyone without the correct key.
+ Decryption: The process of converting ciphertext back into readable plaintext.

So encryption protects the message during transmission, while decryption allows the receiver to recover the original content.
